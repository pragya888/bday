            Heyyy Priyanshu, HAPPY BIRTHDAY BRO !!! <br>
            Well we havn't talked that much yet, still many things to know about each other.
            But yesss, jitna aaj tak interact kiya hai, it has been awesome.
            Kisko pata tha, ki kisi jhagde ki wajah se baat start hogi and dosti mein convert ho jayegi.
            Glad to have a friend like you by my side. You can call me anytime agar pragya pareshaan kare to.
            And broooo *hande erçel* is hot !!!! <br>
